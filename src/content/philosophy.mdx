CSS is getting more and more capable every year, but there are still a few places that it doesn't reach yet. Picobel is a tool to address one of these holdouts: the `<audio>` element.

## What does Picobel do?

Picobel replaces HTML audio elements with alternative markup that has the same functionality but is more easily styleable. It's also configurable, so you can only render the parts you need for your project. Need to include file details, a play-pause button, volume controls and a progress indicator? Picobel has got you covered. Just want a honking-big play button? You got it!
