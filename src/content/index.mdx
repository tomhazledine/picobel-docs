Picobel.js (pronounced _peek-o-bell_, as in _decibel_) is a lightweight dependency-free Javascript tool that converts html audio tags into styleable markup.

## Why would I need this?

There are two reasons you might want to use Picobel:

1. You want a uniform cross-browser experience for the audio players on your site. Pick a pre-made Picobel theme, and you're all set.

2. You're frontender and CSS magician who loves to have control over every aspect the sites you create. You can use the markup-only version of Picobel, and write your own CSS.

The native html `<audio>` tag provides fantastic functionality, but gives you no styling options at all. Picobel rebuilds the audio player with regular html elements: you get all the functionality of the native audio element, _and_ complete control of it's appearance.

## Examples

Using Picobel you can turn this:

<audio src="/audio-examples/taken-at-the-flood.mp3" controls>
    Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.
</audio>

![Native audio player](images/native_players-600.png)

Into this:

<div id="example-01">
    <audio src="/audio-examples/taken-at-the-flood.mp3" controls>
        Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.
    </audio>
</div>

Or this:

<div id="example-02">
    <audio src="/audio-examples/taken-at-the-flood.mp3" controls>
        Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.
    </audio>
</div>

Or this:

<div id="example-03">
    <audio src="/audio-examples/taken-at-the-flood.mp3" controls>
        Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.
    </audio>
</div>

Or even this (if you're crazy):

<div id="example-04">
    <audio src="/audio-examples/taken-at-the-flood.mp3" title="Taken at the Flood" artist="Freeze Theme" controls>
        Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.
    </audio>
</div>

**Picobel** allows you to create custom styles for your audio players: providing cross-browser consistency and a seamless integration with your existing brand styles.

## Quick start

Add Picobel to your project:

```bash
yarn add picobel
```

In your JS, initialise Picobel with your chosen class name:

```js
import picobel from "picobel";

picobel({theme: "my-awesome-audio-player"});
```

Picobel will then find any `<audio>` elements on the page and replace them with markup you can style with CSS.
