Picobel.js (pronounced _peek-o-bell_, as in _decibel_) is a lightweight dependency-free JavaScript tool that converts html audio tags into styleable markup.

<div className="stack--small">
    <p>Using Picobel you can turn a plain old <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> tag that looks like this:</p>
    <audio src="/audio-examples/taken-at-the-flood.mp3" controls>
        Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.
    </audio>
    <p className="audio-credit"><em>Audio source: <a href=""><strong>Freeze Them</strong> on Bandcamp</a></em></p>
</div>

<div className="stack--small">
    <p>...into a fully styled set of elements that looks like this:</p>
    <div id="example-01">
        <audio src="/audio-examples/taken-at-the-flood.mp3" data-artist="Freeze Them" title="Taken at the Flood" controls>
            Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.
        </audio>
    </div>

```js
import picobel from "picobel";

picobel({ theme: "default" });
```
</div>


<div className="stack--small">
    <p>Or maybe like this:</p>
    <div id="example-02">
        <audio src="/audio-examples/taken-at-the-flood.mp3" controls>
            Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.
        </audio>
    </div>

```js
import picobel from "picobel";

picobel({
    theme: "bare",
    components: ["playPause", "timer", "duration", "progress"]
});
```
</div>

<div className="stack--small">
    <p>Or how about some retro media-player vibes?</p>
    <div id="example-03">
        <audio src="/audio-examples/taken-at-the-flood.mp3" controls data-artist="Freeze Them" title="Taken at the Flood">
            Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.
        </audio>
        <p className="audio-credit"><em>* Not in any way affiliated with the creators of the iTunes player</em></p>
    </div>

```js
import picobel from "picobel";

picobel({ theme: "itunes" });
```
</div>

<div className="stack--small">
    <p>You can apply whatever styles you like (<em>Note: this monstrosity is <strong>not</strong> an officially-supported theme!)</em></p>
    <div id="example-04">
        <audio src="/audio-examples/taken-at-the-flood.mp3" title="Taken at the Flood" data-artist="Freeze Them" controls>
            Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.
        </audio>
    </div>

```js
import picobel from "picobel";

picobel({
    theme: "comic-sans-ftw",
    components: [
        "playPause",
        "mute",
        [
            ["title", "artist"],
            ["timer", "progress", "duration"]
        ]
    ]
});
```
</div>

</div>

## Why would I need this?

There are two reasons you might want to use Picobel:

1. You want a uniform cross-browser experience for the audio players on your site. Pick a pre-made Picobel theme, and you're all set.

2. You're frontender and CSS magician who loves to have control over every aspect the sites you create. You can use the markup-only version of Picobel, and write your own CSS.

The native html `<audio>` tag provides fantastic functionality, but gives you no styling options at all. Picobel rebuilds the audio player with regular html elements: you get all the functionality of the native audio element, _and_ complete control of it's appearance.
