> **Note:** Experimental as of version 3.0.3

Picobel is also available as a HTML Web Component (because why not?!). 
    
<picobel-player data-theme="default">
    <audio
        src="/audio-examples/taken-at-the-flood.mp3"
        title="Taken at the Flood"
        data-artist="Freeze Them"
        controls
    >
        Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.
    </audio>
</picobel-player>

```html
<picobel-player data-theme="default">
    <audio
        src="/audio-examples/taken-at-the-flood.mp3"
        title="Taken at the Flood"
        data-artist="Freeze Them"
        controls
    >
        Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.
    </audio>
<picobel-player/>
```

> **Note:** by wrapping an HTML `<audio>` tag with Picobel, you're ensuring Picobel runs as a progressive enhancement. If the JS fails to load, for whatever reason, your users will still see a functional audio player.

## Useage

To use the component, grab the [source from GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomhazledine/picobel/main/build/picobel-component.js) and include it at the bottom of your page with a `<script>` tag. If you want to use a [theme](/themes), include the CSS in the [same way as with regular Picobel](/getting-started/#css-optional). Now you can use the `<picobel-player>` component (and if you're usingh a theme be sure to set the `data-theme` attribute to the theme-name so the relevant styles are applied).

```html
<!-- Add the stylesheet in your <head>... -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/picobel.default.css" />

<!-- And add the script tag at the bottom of the page... -->
<script src="/picobel-component.js"></script>
```

If you're using npm, then you can import the component JS directly from the package:

```js
import "picobel/build/picobel-component.js";
```

## Examples

### 1. `<picobel-player>` loaded with no inbuilt styles

<picobel-player class="bare">
    <audio src="/audio-examples/taken-at-the-flood.mp3" controls>
        Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.
    </audio>
</picobel-player>

```html
<picobel-player>
    <audio src="/audio-examples/taken-at-the-flood.mp3" controls>
        Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.
    </audio>
</picobel-player>
```

### 2. `<picobel-player>` loaded with `data-theme="skeleton"`

<picobel-player data-theme="skeleton">
    <audio
        src="/audio-examples/taken-at-the-flood.mp3"
        title="Taken at the Flood"
        data-artist="Freeze Them"
        controls
    >
        Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.
    </audio>
</picobel-player>

```html
<picobel-player data-theme="skeleton">
    <audio
        src="/audio-examples/taken-at-the-flood.mp3"
        title="Taken at the Flood"
        data-artist="Freeze Them"
        controls
    >
        Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.
    </audio>
</picobel-player>
```

### 3. `<picobel-player-default>`

> **Note:** Even more experimental.

I'm toying with the idea of releasing bundled components that come with theme-styles built in.  `<picobel-player-default>` and `<picobel-player-skeleton>` are currently available for testing (although extremely alpha, as of v3.0.3).

<picobel-player-default>
    <audio
        src="/audio-examples/taken-at-the-flood.mp3"
        title="Taken at the Flood"
        data-artist="Freeze Them"
        controls
    >
        Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.
    </audio>
</picobel-player-default>

```html
<picobel-player-default>
    <audio
        src="/audio-examples/taken-at-the-flood.mp3"
        title="Taken at the Flood"
        data-artist="Freeze Them"
        controls
    >
        Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element.
    </audio>
</picobel-player-default>
```
